## Part 2 (30%)
# 
# Exctract the values of the activations of AlexNet on the face images. Use 
# those as features in order to perform face classification: learn a fully-
# connected neural network that takes in the activations of the units in the 
# AlexNet layer as inputs, and outputs the name of the person. In your report, 
# include a description of the system you built and its performance, similarly 
# to part 1. It is possible to improve on the results of Part 2 by reducing the 
# error rate by at least 30%. I recommend starting out with only using the conv4 
# activations (for Part 2, only using conv4 is sufficient.)
# 
# You should modify the AlexNet code so that the image is put into a placeholder 
# variable.
